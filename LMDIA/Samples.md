> ```In a recent interview with The Daily Beast, President Donald Trump called for a "major investigation" into voter fraud, saying that ```**```"I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER    FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....many people who are registered …who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will      strengthen up voting procedures!"```** ```Trump went on to suggest that his investigation will focus on voter fraud in three areas: "those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal     and.....many people who are registered...who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!"  While the president is right that many illegal voters cast ballots in the presidential election that he won, there is little evidence that illegal or fraudulent voting actually occurred in the 2016 elections. According to Politifact, in the 2016 presidential election, "there was no evidence the election was ever tainted with fraud."  But Trump's claim that millions voted illegally is not based on any evidence and is based on the   belief that a person's status as an undocumented immigrant should be enough to disqualify them from registering to vote.

In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Trump said that he was terminating Comey because of the agency's investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia during   the 2016 presidential election.  ```**```"While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the   Department of Justice that you are not able to lead the Bureau,"```** ```Trump wrote.  The White House said that Trump's decision was based on Rosenstein's recommendation, as well as on his own       opinions about Comey's conduct over the years.  But Trump said he has "received the recommendations of both Rod Rosenstein, who is greatly respected, and Christopher Wray, who I have known for  a long time."  Trump's decision was first reported by The New York Times.```  **```"The FBI is one of our nation's most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for   our crown jewel of law enforcement,"```** ```Trump said.
