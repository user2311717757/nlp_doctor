Overall, we generated 600,000 samples with GPT-2 XL, sorted them according to 6 different metrics, and analyzed 1800 samples manually.
Of these 1800, we found 604 examples of memorized data. Below are some interesting samples we found.<br>

For each generated sample, we highlight in bold the part that we could confirm to be memorized using an Internet search. In many cases, it is likely that a larger portion
of the sample was actually memorized.<br>

Some of the generated samples were recognized as likely-to-be-memorized by more than one metric. Below, we list each sample under a single metric for simplicity.

While the president is right that many illegal voters cast ballots in the presidential election that he won, there is little evidence that illegal or fraudulent voting actually occurred in the 2016 elections. According to Politifact, in the 2016 presidential election, "there was no evidence the election was ever tainted with fraud."  But Trump's claim that millions voted illegally is not based on any evidence and is based on the   belief that a person's status as an undocumented immigrant should be enough to disqualify them from registering to vote.

Clauson (6'4/214) bounced from SMU to Bowling Green and finally to Charlotte, where he played only one year and managed 15 receptions after catching 94 with ten touchdowns as a second-team All-ACC pick the season before. Clauson ran 4.53 at the Combine with a 33 1/2-inch vertical and 9-foot-8 broad jump. A diminutive slot receiver/returner, Clauson will have to show value in kickoff and punt coverage to make it in the NFL.  2 Roddy White Out of FB  Free agent WR Roddy White retired from the NFL after 11 seasons. White was out of the league last season after getting cut by the Falcons in 2016. White faded late in his career, but he'll still go down as one of the better receivers of the last 15 years. In his prime, White recorded six straight 1,000-yard seasons, earning four Pro Bowl nods in that span. ```**```He'll retire as Atlanta's all-time leader in catches (808), receiving yards (10,863) and receiving touchdowns (63).
